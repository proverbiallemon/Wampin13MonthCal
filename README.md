## üéØ Why 13 Months?

The 13-month calendar offers several advantages over the traditional Gregorian calendar:

### Perfect Regularity
- **Every month has exactly 28 days** (4 complete weeks)
- **Same date = Same weekday** all year (e.g., the 15th is always the same day of the week)
- **52 perfect weeks** with no split weeks across months

### Better Planning
- **Predictable patterns** make scheduling easier
- **Monthly comparisons** are accurate (all months have the same number of days)
- **Payroll & billing cycles** align perfectly with months

### Natural Alignment
- **28-day months** closely match the lunar cycle (~29.5 days)
- **13 months √ó 28 days = 364 days** plus New Year's Day
- **Quarters** can be 3-3-3-4 months for even distribution

## üé® Themes
